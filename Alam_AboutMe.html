    <p>Hey, I'm Wasi! </p>


<p> The combination of filmmaking, photography, programming, and graphic design skills with a creative design sense and passionate entrepreneurial drive is the perfect recipe for tons of unique ideas flowing out of this young silicon valley creator. My goal is to be able to spread a positive message through my filmmaking skills, and to be able to make a living as well. Being able to portray a story and your own perspective through a creative outlet such as film absolutely amazes me and is what keeps me hooked on filmmaking. Coding simply expands the possibilities as to what you can do with films, including animations.I have a deep passion for photography, filmmaking, coding, and design. Ever since I picked up camera at a young age, I've been in love with the art of photography and filmmaking.

<p>
In order to make great films, and in order to be a successful entrepreneur, one has to have internal drive to do more and more. You also have to have creativity. Shown through my photography, and contribution to many short films and film projects for the school, I have both of these attributes. The young and upcoming world of creative people is very competitive, and to keep your game up, you have to constantly be learning. Having a positive, learning, and open mindset helps tremendously benefit how much you can learn. As a growing filmmaker, photographer, and coder, I am always looking for ways to improve myself to stay ahead of the competition. Adopting new techniques, and trying new, risky ideas with projects are a way I progress myself forward and hold myself accountable for my work. No complacency.
</p>
<p>
A few awards I have received are: principals honors roll in both semesters of freshmen year, recognition and appreciation for my contribution to the “Every 15 Minutes” film for Amador Valley High School from the councilwoman, recognition from the Dublin Unified District school board for making a video about Fallon Middle School in seventh grade, and working with a non-profit organization “Yours Humanly” and driving their videography and photography division. I also am the president of the Video Production Club at Dublin High School. Alongside, I also run track (distance) during track and field season. Juggling many items, along with advanced placement classes all at once is no easy task. Time management is a key skill that I will always be learning more and perfecting to help increase my own productivity and be able to fit more into my schedule. Again, learning never stops.
