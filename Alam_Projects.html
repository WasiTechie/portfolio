I used python coding and if-else statements to code this game. This game was an NBA playoffs bracket game. First, you choose either East or West side. Then, you continue choosing between two teams. If you select one wrong team, you lose. If you select all the correct teams, you win! In order to code this game, a long if-else statement was used. Lots of debugging was also required. I worked with Daniel Zhong on this project and our team dynamic was great. We first brainstormed what our text adventure game would be about. Then, we devised a way to approach the coding. Then, we coded the game. Overall, this game was really fun to code!

I used Python and the Python Image Library (PIL) to make a program for a client which can manipulate an image. Various manipulations can be added such as borders, and a watermark/company logo can also be placed over the image. I worked with Vince Tan on this project. Through this project, I learned how to code better in python and how to debug, which was a vital skill in this project. One of the problems encountered was not being able to paste an image onto all the documents in a folder. Through debugging and research, this problem was also solved.

<br></br>
I used Massachusetts Institute of Technology's App Inventor to create the "Photo Booth” app. The Photo Booth app was my second project. There was a tutorial given for certain parts of the app, but all of the extra features had to be coded. I worked with Vince Tan, and together we were challenged to add more ideas and useful features to the application. Scratch is very similar to App Inventor, though App Inventor allows for more flexibility and features. Also, App Inventor is meant to create Android Apps, whereas Scratch can only create apps for the Scratch platform. After a few weeks of tough coding and debugging, Vince and I were able lock in and create an amazing and useful application that allows the user to take a picture using the device's front and back facing camera and edit the picture using lines and colors. After taking the picture from the camera page, the picture is stored on one of the four canvases. The picture can be taken to the edit page from there. The user then has the flexibility to draw on the image, and apply different effects to it. Overall this was a successful project as we were able to implement everything we wanted into the application. During this project, I learned that even the smallest typos can make a huge difference. Also, debugging is a crucial and tough part in the programming process.  </div>

I used Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Scratch to create the "Shark” app. The Shark Chase app was my first project. There was no tutorial given for any parts of the game. I worked with Yasmin, and together we were challenged to add more ideas and features to the game. Scratch is very similar to App Inventor, though App Inventor allows for more flexibility and features. Also, App Inventor is meant to create Android Apps, whereas Scratch can only create apps for the Scratch platform. After a few weeks of tough block coding and debugging, Yasmin and I were able lock in and create an amazing game that allows the user to navigate through a maze running from a shark while collecting various prizes such as coins. Overall this was a successful project as we were able to implement everything we wanted into the game. During this project, I learned that even the smallest mistypes in block code can make a huge difference. Also, debugging is a crucial and tough part in the programming process.  </div>
